Your task is to fully implement and integrate every process across all ERP modules in Unanza into a complete, production-ready full-stack system. Unanza is a multi-tenant, hierarchical ERP with strict multi-company isolation, ACID-safe workflows, and interconnected transactions across Sales, Warehouse, Financials, HR, and System modules. You must ensure that all modules work end-to-end using real workflow orchestration rather than direct status patching. The backend already contains a comprehensive workflow engine in server/services/workflow-service.ts, including sales order confirmation, delivery generation, invoice creation, AR/AP ledger entries, purchase order confirmations, goods receipts, payment processing, and journal entry automation. You must expose these workflows through properly scoped API endpoints (e.g., POST /sales-orders/:id/confirm, /deliver, /invoice, /payments/receive, /purchase-orders/:id/confirm, /receive, /bill, /payments/pay) and remove all direct PATCH status mutations. Update the frontend to call these workflow endpoints from UI actions using TanStack Query, invalidate all related caches, and build UI flows that respect all master-data dependencies, including customers, vendors, products, COA accounts, stock locations, and warehouses. All operations must strictly enforce company_id filtering, hierarchical access control, and role permissions following the multi-company RBAC rules. Remove all dummy data; every record—company, user, customer, vendor, product, warehouse, COA, sales order, delivery, invoice, journal entry—must be created organically through the proper workflow screens by the user, ensuring realistic and consistent ERP behavior. All transactions must execute inside ACID-safe db.transaction() blocks using row-level locking and SELECT FOR UPDATE to prevent concurrency issues and duplicate document numbers. Integrate every step of each module so that sales orders reserve stock, deliveries decrement inventory and generate COGS, invoices generate AR/AP entries, payments settle outstanding invoices, goods receipts update stock valuations, purchase orders trigger AP workflows, and all journal entries are posted automatically using the correct account mappings. Ensure the frontend, backend, and database operate as one fully synchronized ERP engine with strict validation, error handling, workflow correctness, and complete multi-company isolation.
